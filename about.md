I am a Fashion Design student at The Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago pursuing to be a Technical Designer. I love women's contemporary ready-to-wear silhouttes with embroideries and embellishments inspired by different cultures around the world. I am a Fashion Graduate from Pearl Academy of Fashion, India where I worked in the industry for three years. 

I live in Chicago with my husband. I enjoy watching movies and love trying different cuisines. I am originally from Kota, Rajasthan in India and love Indian textiles and embroideries.
