title: How to Make a Halter Dress
---

This is a dress I made for a draping project. We were suppose to make a dress with halter top, mid-riff and a flared skirt. I am sharing the process of sewing part.

- Cut all the patterns for self and lining. Baste the armhole, neckline and the skirt. Make sure you transfer all the notches. You want to baste all the seams that might stretch for they are cut on a bias or fall diagonal from the grain line.

- With wrong sides together of self and lining sew the side seam and the neckline. Clip the corners and the seams to flip it with wrong sides facing together. Gather the front to the needed measurement and secure it with sewing. Repeat for the other side. So now you have the halter top front panel ready to be joined. Start sewing from the center front attaching the two panels to finish the halter top front.

- Attach the midriff panel to the top. Sewing the lining and self to the respective panels of the top.

- Take the back panel and sew it to the front.

- Sew the skirt leaving the back open for the zipper. MARK the notches for the zipper on the skirt on both sides. attach the ready halter top to the skirt leaving the center back open for the zipper.

- To determine the right size of the zipper, measure the widest area of the body and take the zipper to match the length. If it is a concealed zipper, use a concealed zipper foot. It works well, but control the speed of your stitches. Sometimes going too fast get the zip stuck in the zipper foot.

- Be careful while sewing the zipper. You want to make sure the waistlines match so mark and read your notches carefully.

- Fold the hem to the required measurement and sew it on the outside or you can finish it with hemming.

- Place the mark for the buttons and the button hole at the strap.

And you're done!
