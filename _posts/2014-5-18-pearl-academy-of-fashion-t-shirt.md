It was a Friday evening of December 2009, the year I got my Bachelor's degree from Pearl Academy of Fashion in Fashion Design. I was working with a company that made uniforms for Luxury Hotels, it was not my the dream job neither did it pay my bills but gave me connections and confidence.

I took a week off from work to visit my Grandparents and was packing for a trip to the jungles of Bastar (India). They are known for tribal art but also infamous for notorious Naxal activities. We planned to stay in a forest rest house in the middle of the jungle, which had no electricity and no reception for phones. I was excited! Just then, my professor Rahul Gupta sent me a text saying, "I need a favor."

We had college fest towards the end of the year after the semester got over. Our school had a students' body spearheaded by Mr. Gupta. He wanted me to do the T-shirt as they had to get them printed for the fest, which was in weeks time. It was supposed to be done by the students, but to my surprise no one showed interest! It was 7:00 PM. I was not sure if I will be able to finish it as we had to leave early in the morning next day. Mr.Gupta asked me to give it a try and send the best I could, we decided to stay up all night until we froze on something that he could print. There has never been a graduation t-shirt in 12 years, ever since the first campus in New Delhi started. It was the first, and all firsts comes with an expectations.

Mr. Gupta gave me a brief on the t-shirt design, he did his research. He found out the printer, color and the fabric that was readily available. So, grey it was as the base color and rubber print for the medium. I had to come up with something that will look good in grey, unisex collared t-shirt. So we worked over it until 4 in the morning. I gave him 4 options to choose from and worked on the one he selected and made it as per the brief.

When I came back from my trip, I was thrilled to see the photos of all the students wearing our one night creation! My professor always had his ways of showing his gratitude. And this one surprised me as I had my name printed at the back of all the t shirts. This was the only t-shirt made between the four campuses in Dhaka, Chennai, New Delhi and Jaipur and continues to be worn up to this date. It was a good opportunity to payback. I was able to do my share :) Thank you Sir!
